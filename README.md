 	# Iris Classification with GUI

	This project implements a machine learning model to classify the famous Iris dataset using a graphical user interface (GUI). The Iris dataset contains three classes of flowers: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica, with 50 samples for each class.

	## Features
	- Trains a model to classify iris species based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
	- GUI interface to allow users to input feature values and see predictions in real time.

 	3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or the Python script containing the GUI.

	## Dependencies
	- Python 3
	requirements pandas,tkinter.

	## Usage
	The GUI allows users to manually input the flower's features, and the model will predict the corresponding Iris species.

	## Dataset
	The Iris dataset is available in the public domain and is commonly used for testing classification algorithms.

	
	#if any user finds any problem you can contact rahugagan26@gmail.com am happy to help
	#download the .csv file and .ipynb file upload that file in Jupyter and then run
	#install all the Important libraries
	#I have attached the data and you can download that from Kaggle
